# Simon

Play Simon in your browser by downloading the HTML file.

Simon is a game in which the computer generates a random sequence of four colors that the player then has to repeat back to the computer. The
game ends when you choose the wrong color in the sequence. The sequence starts out short and is successively built up over the course of the game. There 
are three levels of Simon that you can play: easy (add one color to the sequence each round), medium (add two colors to the sequence each round), or 
hard (add three colors to the sequence each round).
